<p>This rule avoids Deficient Encapsulation</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Example</h2>
<p>
    When the declared accessibility of one or more members of an abstraction is more permissive than actually required.
</p>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>
    1.If this parameter is to be used by other classes, change its modifier to "not public" and generate "a public
    method" for other classes to obtain the parameter.<br>
    2.If this parameter is not to be used by other classes, then change its modifier "not public".
