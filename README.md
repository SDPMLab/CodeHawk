CodeHawk is an extension of SonarQube which can analyze software smells for Java souce code. 

To improve software quality, effective software development teams often use source code analysis tools to help them detect and refactor poor structures in the source code. In order to detect software smells automatically, CodeHawk extends SonarQube for detecting software code smells, design smells and architecture smells.
